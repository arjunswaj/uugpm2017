### Inspiration
Back in 2014, I had written a kickass [scraper script](https://github.com/arjunswaj/loksabha2014/tree/master/DataCollection/src/com/asb/analysis) and [SQL queries](https://github.com/arjunswaj/loksabha2014/blob/master/Reports/queries.sql) to do analysis of Lok Sabha Elections. From 2014, not a lot has changed in the election commission s [results website](http://eciresults.nic.in). So I ran the script today after the election results of the states - Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur and Punjab were announced. 
I added some [IOMonads](https://github.com/arjunswaj/uugpm2017/blob/master/src/com/asb/elections/Scraper.java#L28-L35) to make the running of the script more fun. Surprisingly, the SQL and the scraper worked flawlessly! Without making you wait further, I shall share the results below:

#### Cost Analysis
EC allowed up to INR [16 Lakhs](http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/Contesting.aspx) for election expenditure. Assuming that every candidate spent exactly 70 lakhs, we see some interesting results. Cost per seat excludes parties that won no seats.

##### Cost per vote.
